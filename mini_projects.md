# These are the list of projects suggested but you are free to choose your own topic as well.


1. Deep fake detection challenge
    - We will use the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/overview
    - Explore different deep neural network architectures 
    - Copying existing notebooks will result in disqualification 
    - The solution should be using tensorflow APIs or pytorch or any other framework

2. Textual entailment task
    - Given two sentences classify if first sentence follows from second sentence or if they are unrelated
    - We will use two datasets for this task Fever 2.0 dataset https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/fever.public/fever2-fixers-dev.jsonl and https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news-pair-classification-challenge

3. Background news linking task from TREC 2020
    - see the details here http://trec-news.org/guidelines-2020.pdf

4. Hyperpartisan new detection
    - Use the labelled data for hyperpartisan news detection here https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2017-08-partisan-sites-and-facebook-pages 
    - Train a classifier for the hyperpartisan news detection
    - More details on the task is defined here 

5. Reinforcement learning
    - In this project, students can experiment and learn about various reinforcement learning algorithms within the arena of Atari games from OpenAI's gym. 
    - This project will give students the opportunity to explore the challenges and tradeoffs associated with different algorithms. 
    - Students are welcome to apply algorithms from well-known libraries, ie. stable-baselines.
    - Resources: 
        - https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/
        - https://gym.openai.com/envs/#atari
